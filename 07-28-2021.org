** Progress
I've made slower progress over the last week or two.

I've just finished Chapter 6 of Mastronarde; by the end of this
chapter, you will have seen the forms for all of the Α-declension (1st
declension) nouns, and been introduced to more prepositions.
** General learning process

Right now, the way I generally move through a chapter is as follows:
1. Read / skim it once, and create flashcards for any pre-requisite
   knowledge, as well as vocabulary where I have already learned the
   forms
2. Read it carefully, and make flashcards for vocabulary for *new*
   types of forms
3. For non-translation exercises (e.g. identification), do only the
   odd-numbered exercises
4. For translation exercises ("Translate the following into Greek",
   "Translate the following sentences into English"), do *all* exercises
5. Several days later, review the exercises
6. Start a new chapter

Depending on how much time I have, any number of these steps could be
a part of the same "session" (chunk of time in one day), but I've been
trying to shoot for smaller amounts of time per day (<= 60 minutes)
just to make sure I don't find the commitment burdensome. In the long
run, I will read and understand Greek, as long as I can make forward
progress and maintain a commitment, as small as it may be; that is the
truth of this venture. Making it easy to stay committed over a long
period of time is more important than anything else.

In learning the verbs in Chapter 5, I also made the decision for now
to only learn a single form, and not all the principal parts.

** Reflections

*** The Present Active Indicative can be translated into an interrogative form

This block:
#+begin_quote
λύετε τὴν δημοκρατίαν
#+end_quote

Can be rendered as "You (plural) overthrow / dissolve the democracy,"
and "Are you (plural) overthrowing / dissolving the democracy?" The
latter is harder for me to remember as a possible translation.

*** Translation difficulties
- It's relatively easy to render basic Greek into an acceptable -- not
  necessarily eloquent -- English, but rendering English into Greek is
  much more uncertain for a noobie. I suspect that these
  challenges apply for rendering of *any* uninflected language into a
  highly inflected language, not just English to Greek. It must be
  even more challenging for translating a highly inflected language to
  another highly inflected language.
  - Many possible "equivalent" translations with different word
    ordering and emphasis
  - In general, whether to translate literally or "idiomatically"
    - This is further made difficult by not knowing what is idiomatic
      without reading more Greek!
    - For example, when translating English into Greek, should I
      follow, as much as possible, the general Greek structure of
      subject, DO, IO, verb? Or should I translate as literally as
      possible? I can probably answer this myself by cross-referencing
      Mastronarde's answer key to see what general pattern he follows.
      - Sometimes, to test myself, I will also write sentences
        multiple ways in the exercises just to see which ones "fit"
        the best.
  - How to translate prepositional phrases (are these determined by
    rules or context)? For example, is it correct to render the
    following sentence as either of: "The general (among/with the soldiers)
    abandons the tent and the horses", or "The general abandons the
    tent and the horses among/with the soldiers?" If one reading is
    more acceptable, how do we know? See below:

#+begin_quote
οἱ στρατηγοὶ μετὰ τῶν στρατιωτῶν τὰς σκηνὰς καὶ τὰς ἵππους λείπουσιν
#+end_quote

*** Memorizing rules
- If you are going to memorize rules, memorize the most general rules,
  but don't spend time memorizing exceptions.

- Memorizing accent rules is less useful than recognizing the
  patterns, and collecting some examples across the different patterns
  that you can review.

*** Prepositions
- There are lots of prepositions with slightly different contextual meanings
  - In order to make sense of them more easily, I'm considering making
    a spreadsheet of an adjacency matrix of prepositions with the
    associated cases they can take on.
    - For example, διά would have an adjacency with both the genitive
      and dative. This is helpful for giving a quick visual index, but
      isn't too helpful for much more detail, so a more sophisticated
      diagram or visual might be more desirable.

*** Learning how to Learn
- It's always a work in progress, but I'm still trying to figure out
  the best way to learn Greek by myself. There's no how to guide, but
  once I make it to the end of the text, I'd like to make a guide for
  others in my shoes.


** Corrections
I think I found one issue so far in the answer key for:
- Unit 5, Section 4, #5

ἐθελομεν is missing an acute accent on the antepenult.
** Things to try for next time
- Try making some diagrams, visuals, spreadsheets, even software, to
  help me learn more deeply, or more efficiently (e.g. make Anki
  flashcards faster and automatically)
- Review all of the resources that Mastronarde makes available. There
  are a ton over at [[http://atticgreek.org/index.html][the official website for the text]].
